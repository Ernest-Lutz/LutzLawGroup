Personal injuries
Personal injury covers any wrong or damage done to another in his person, property, rights, or reputation. Injuries can happen at work, in a traffic accident, because of a faulty product or a faulty repair, because of a mistake during medical treatment, or because you slipped and fell on pavement or on a wet floor. The injury can be physical or psychological, but, to have a  case, it must occur due to the negligence or unreasonably unsafe actions of your employer, a manufacturer, your doctor, your landlord, or some other person or organization who owes you a duty of ordinary care.

Car accidents
When someone is injured or killed in a motor vehicle accident, their life and those of their family members change forever. The physical, emotional and financial strain that follows is difficult to deal with alone.
There are laws that are supposed to provide assistance to victims of motor vehicle accidents. The government, however, heavily regulates the laws governing motor vehicle accidents. The insurance companies know their rights and know how to use them to meet their objectives. You should too.
Ernest Lutz has represented and helped thousands of people whose lives have been affected by a motor vehicle accident.
